                <p>We designed this event to supplement the lack of solid opportunities for continuing education, skill building and community outside of college and the 4-hour workshop. ⁣⁣</p>
                <h4>I’m not local to Memphis. Where should I stay?</h4>
                <p>Our friends at the Courtyard Memphis Downtown have provided Skill Camp attendees with a solid group rate. Book your room today.</p>

                <p>No. This event is for creatives of all ages who are serious about their craft and want to sharpen their skills, learn how others work and develop in-person relationships with a larger community of creators from all over the country. Track requirements are posted above.</p>
                <h4>What will I get out of it?⁣⁣</h4>
                <p>Transformative skill growth and community. Learn skills that take your work to the next level and develop relationships and accountability with a small group of likeminded professionals. ⁣⁣</p>
